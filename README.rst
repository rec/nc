ðŸŽ¨ ``nc``: Extensible color names in Python ðŸŽ¨
-----------------------------------------------------

``nc`` names color.

There are two ways to use ``nc``.

The simple way is as an intuitive and forgiving interface to a collection of
over 2000 named colors, put together from almost 20 color palettes scraped from
the Internet.


In the simplest use, it's a collection of about 1700 colors, some
scraped from the Wikipedia (which includes some very strange colors),
with a neat API.

For more precise use, color collections can be put together from schemes built
into ``nc`` (currently ``html``, ``juce``, ``pwg``, ``wikipedia``, ``x11``), and
from custom color schemes created by the user.

Install ``nc`` from the command line using
`pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install nc

EXAMPLES:

.. code-block:: python

   import nc

   for c in nc.red, nc.light_green, nc.DarkGrey, nc['PUCE']:
       print(c, '=', *c)

   # Prints:
   #   Red = 255 0 0
   #   Light green = 144 238 144
   #   Dark grey = 85 85 85
   #   Puce = 204 136 153

   # Colors have red, green, blue or r, g, b components
   assert nc.yellow.red == nc.yellow.r == 0
   assert nc.yellow.green == nc.yellow.g == 255
   assert nc.yellow.blue == nc.yellow.b == 255

   # Lots of ways to reach colors
   assert nc.black == nc(0, 0, 0) == nc('0, 0, 0') == nc('(0, 0, 0)') == nc(0)

   # ``nc`` looks like a dict
   assert nc.red == nc['red'] == nc['RED']
   for name, color in nc.items():
       print(name, '=', *color)

   # Prints:
   #   Absolute Zero = 0 72 186
   #   Acid green = 176 191 26
   #   Aero = 124 185 232
   #   ... many more

   # closest() function

   from random import randrange
   for i in range(8):
       c1 = randrange(256), randrange(256), randrange(256)
       c2 = nc.closest(c1)
       print(c1, 'is closest to', c2, *c2)

   # Prints:
   #   (193, 207, 185) is closest to Honeydew 3 = 193 205 193
   #   (181, 162, 188) is closest to Lilac = 200 162 200
   #   (122, 110, 250) is closest to Slate blue 1 = 131 111 255
   #   (56, 218, 180) is closest to Turquoise = 64 224 208
